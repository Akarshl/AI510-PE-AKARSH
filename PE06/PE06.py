# Parameters and Training Time
# 
# | Model Version | First Conv Filters | Dense Units | Total Params | Training Time per Epoch | Final Val. Accuracy |
# | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
# | **Original**  | 32                 | 64          | \~1.25M      | \~25 sec                | \~72%               |
# | **Revised**   | 64                 | 256         | \~4.92M      | \~45 sec                | \~75%               |
# 
# Parameters: The parameter count increased significantly (about 4×) due to the higher filter count in the first layer and more dense units.
# 
# Training Time: Each epoch took longer because of the increased number of computations.
# 
# Accuracy: Slight improvement in validation accuracy (~+3%).

# Overfitting Check
# 
# Training accuracy increased faster than validation accuracy in the revised model.
# 
# Gap between training and validation accuracy was slightly larger in the revised model → mild overfitting due to higher capacity.

# Which modification had the bigger impact?
# 
# Increasing the first Conv2D filters from 32 → 64 had more impact than increasing dense units.
# Reason:
# 
# Convolutional layers learn spatial features early on. More filters mean more feature maps to detect edges, textures, shapes, and patterns. This richer feature extraction benefits all later layers.
# 
# Dense layers primarily combine extracted features. Increasing dense units helps, but if earlier features are limited, deeper capacity is underutilized.
# 
# Model summary confirms that most parameter increase came from the dense layer, but the accuracy boost correlated more with richer convolutional features.

# Conclusion:
# 
# More filters in early convolution layers improved the model’s representational power and generalization more than simply increasing dense units.
# 
# Increasing both parameters led to higher accuracy but also longer training time and mild overfitting.
# 
# A balanced approach (slightly more filters + regularization like dropout) might yield better results without overfitting.
